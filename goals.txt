What I want for Beta/V1:
1. search a user-specified database for files, and display them in a list inside of a GUI.
1a. Have the user input as many or as few folders as 
they wish and specifically exclude types of files 
(separated into Music, Video, Pictures, and Misc)
or just file extensions. Auto remove application
files, such as .exe, .js, .java, .bat, .dll, etc.
2. Check files on previously mentioned list for metadata, and put them in separate lists as a result.
2a. Look for metadata, and make lists that user 
cannot see, make these lists into 3 categories:
Album Metadata, only Artist metadata, and 
No Discriminating metadata.
3. Have a file system created in a user-specified area, sorting the music.
3a. Have the default export folder be the user's music folder. Sort by
default in the structure "Album/Artist/Song.???" Have the files containing
no metadata for the Album, but MD for the Artist in "By Artist/Artist/Song.???"
4. Export the files into respective folders and keep the GUI open, with the non-exported files still there
4a. Allow the user to add metadata to files after first export.
Allow the user to keep going until they are satisfied.
Use a Command prompt interface to move files and make folders
but hide the interface from the user. Allow the user to state whether
or not they would like empty folders deleted.
5. Export cover art images as well
5a. If there is more then 10MB of other files, and NO more music files containing metadata,
take the image files, clear them with the user, and move them to the fs as cover art.
